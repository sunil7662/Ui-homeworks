bootstrap:
	Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. It is used to make the web page responsive.

Grid system Bootstrap:
		Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size.
		The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:
			xs (for phones)
			sm (for tablets)
			md (for desktops)
			lg (for larger desktops)
		The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

12 columns are possible per row in the bootstrap.
