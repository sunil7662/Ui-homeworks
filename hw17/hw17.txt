Ajax:
	--Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh. The best definition I've read for Ajax is the method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page – without reloading the entire page.

$.ajax:
	--function is used to perform an asynchronous HTTP request.
